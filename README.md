## 1. ‚úÖ Project Overview

AgriAlert is a full-stack, USSD/SMS-enabled pest and disease reporting and advisory platform for smallholder farmers in rural regions. The system enables farmers to report crop health issues via SMS/USSD in local languages, while agricultural officers and experts can respond through a web-based dashboard with tailored advice or escalation protocols.

---

## 2. üéØ Core Objectives

- Enable farmers with basic phones to report pest and disease incidents in real-time via USSD/SMS.
- Log, analyse, and visualise these reports centrally for agricultural officers.
- Automate responses using a knowledge base and send advisories via SMS.
- Provide administrators with tools to track outbreaks geographically and temporally.

## 3. üß∞ Tech Stack and System Architecture

| Layer               | Technology Used                 | Notes                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Frontend UI         | **React.js**                    | Dashboard for admin/ag officers     |
| Backend API         | **Node.js + Express**           | RESTful API, logic, SMS handling    |
| Database            | **MySQL**                       | Farmers, reports, alerts, logs      |
| SMS/USSD Gateway    | **Africa‚Äôs Talking** (or Twilio) | Inbound & outbound SMS/USSD        |
| Hosting             | Render / Railway / Vercel       | Modular deployment & scaling        |
| Auth (Optional)     | JWT-based login for officers    | Role-based access control           |

## 4. üì¶ Database Design Overview

### Tables:
- **farmers** ‚Äì Farmer records, contact, location, language
- **pest_reports** ‚Äì Reports from farmers (crop, issue, location, time, status)
- **alerts** ‚Äì SMS messages sent, timestamp, content
- **users** ‚Äì Admin/AG officer login and permissions (optional)

---

## 5. üì≤ USSD/SMS Workflow

1. **Farmer** dials USSD code or sends SMS with crop issue.
2. **SMS Gateway** hits the Node.js webhook endpoint.
3. **Backend API** parses and stores the report.
4. Automated SMS sent acknowledging the report and providing relevant guidance.
5. **Admin Dashboard** updates in real-time for officers to review and act on.

---

## 6. üßë‚Äçüåæ User Roles

- **Farmers** (via USSD/SMS): Submit crop-related issues and receive tips.
- **Agricultural Officers** (via Web): Monitor and respond to farmer issues.
- **System Admins**: Manage officers, view metrics, edit knowledge base.

---

## 7. üîí Security & Best Practices

- Input sanitisation & SQL injection protection
- HTTPS-secured endpoints
- .env-based credential management
- Logging & monitoring for SMS delivery and system usage
- Graceful fallback for SMS failures
- Optional offline-first design via SMS retry queue

---

## 8. üìä Future Enhancements

- GPS tagging (if smart-featured phones are used)
- AI/ML classification of symptoms (with image support via WhatsApp)
- Integration with government pest outbreak alert systems
- Knowledge base for automated responses
- Offline-first progressive web app (PWA) for field officers

---

## 9. üß† Insights & Rationale

- **Accessibility First**: Targeting basic phone users ensures inclusion for remote communities.
- **Timeliness**: Early detection and response help contain pest spread and minimise yield loss.
- **Scalability**: The modular design allows future support for additional services (e.g., weather alerts, market prices).
- **Data Value**: Centralised data offers insights into regional trends and can inform policy or intervention programs.

## What It Represents:
- The entry point is a farmer interacting via USSD/SMS.
- A gateway provider (e.g., Africa's Talking or Twilio) forwards the data to your Node.js API.
- The API parses and stores the report in MySQL.
- An acknowledgement SMS is sent automatically.
- The React dashboard reflects updates in real-time.
Officers can respond through the UI, and personalised advisories are sent via SMS.
